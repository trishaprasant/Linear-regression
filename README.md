# Linear-regression

This project uses a dataset from a fake Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. My work here uses a linear regression model to determine whether the company should focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
